      "warning": "Please use caution when disabling a class again, because items that refer to those features will become invalid and vanish. Both your browser console and the Foundry 'Support & Issues' dialog will show you errors. This is expected behaviour. To get rid of the errors you need to make sure no items use the class features you want to disable."

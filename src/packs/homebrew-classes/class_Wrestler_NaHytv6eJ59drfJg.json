Even when their opponents try to run away, Wrestlers can lock them down and keep the fight going with masterful grappling techniques.</p><p>Outside of the ring, Wrestlers bask in the attention of others; their exaggerated swagger isn't all talk as they seem to perform better at tasks when they show off. Their bravado and daring persona can even attract the attention of die-hard fans devoted to supporting their favorite fighter.</p><hr /><h5><strong>WRESTLER FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li><p>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</p></li><li><p>Gain the ability to equip <strong>martial melee weapons</strong> and <strong>martial shields</strong>.</p></li></ul><h2><strong>WRESTLER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.NWXs2Zn1LpBWxRDO]{Cutting Promo (SL2)}</p><p>At the start of a conflict, you may spend 2 Hype to form a Bond with up to <strong>【SL】</strong> strength with a creature you can see.

A fan club is a group of NPCs devoted to your actions and persona. They are willing to cover expenses or perform services up to a total cost of <strong>【(SL + Hype Spent) × 30】</strong> zenit while you are in the settlement. These services may be the ones found in <span style=\"font-family:'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif\">Core Rulebook</span>, page <strong>125</strong>, or other services you and your group may find appropriate. You can change this limit by spending Hype again the next time you enter a settlement with a fan club.</p><div class=\"stackedit__html\"><p>You gain <strong>【SL × 2】</strong>Hype after resting in a settlement where you have a fan club.</p></div><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.smYGm4dxTLgH0JuP]{Grapple (SL3)}</p><p>You may use an action and spend 10 Mind Points to perform an Opposed <strong>【MIG + DEX】 </strong>or <strong>【MIG + MIG】 </strong>Check against a creature you can touch.

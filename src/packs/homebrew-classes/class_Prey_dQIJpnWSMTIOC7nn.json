They might have been another forgotten victim, if not for the moment of strength, inspiration, or pure dumb luck that changed their fate.<br>Now they have a party of allies and a chance, however slim, to strike back at the evil that tried to claim them... as long as they can see past their own fear.</p><hr><h5>PREY <strong>FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li><p>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points or Mind Points by 5</p></li></ul><h2>PREY<strong> SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.Aq4xDd3pP4dQ9fGt]{Cornered Rat} <strong>(SL3)</strong></p><p>If a creature is blocking you from escaping a scene or restraining you, you deal <strong>【SL × 2】</strong>extra damage to them, and get a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】</strong> to Opposed Checks against them.</p><hr><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.IYGc3gbnpqvQBs2y]{Go On Without Me!}</p><p>On another creature’s turn in a conflict scene, you may spend 1 Fabula Point to allow that creature to use an Action to escape from the scene, reappearing in a different scene where you or another Player Character is present. Describe how you created the opportunity, and when they reappear, they’ll describe how they got there!</p><p>After using this Skill, you can’t use the Rogue Skill <strong>See You Later</strong> in the same scene, and another character can’t use <strong>Go On Without Me!</strong> on you. Face your fate.</p><hr><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.aFH53QmpAoUH4aBy]{If It Bleeds…} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>During a conflict scene, when an ally completes a Clock with a successful Check or an enemy with a rank of <strong>elite</strong> or above enters <strong>Crisis</strong> for the first time, choose one: a creature of your choice recovers <strong>【SL × 3】</strong> HP or MP; or the creature who dealt the triggering damage or completed the triggering Clock gains a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】</strong> to their next Check.</p><hr><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.CFyfRtizTPl2mAOd]{Prey Instinct} <strong>(SL3)</strong></p><p>At the start of a conflict, you may spend 10 Mind Points.

You gain a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】</strong> to all Checks you perform as part of the chosen action.</p><p>You cannot use the Rogue Skill <strong>High Speed</strong> in the same scene, or vice-versa.</p><hr><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.8EhoBIexhAqyb0ex]{Vigilance or Paranoia} <strong>(SL4)</strong></p><p>You can identify on sight when <strong>soldier</strong>-rank creatures are searching for you or mean you harm, but this Skill doesn’t reveal their exact intentions. Describe what tipped you off!</p><p>When you are present for the appearance or revelation of a Villain, you may immediately spend a Fabula Point to ask the GM a question about how the party could escape or hinder the Villain (but not to attack or defeat them.) The first Player Character to act on this answer gains a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】</strong> to their Check.</p></div><p></p><h3>PREY NOTES</h3><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-handouts.JournalEntry.fArjgN0xF1QmhtXe]{Prey Rules}</p><p></p><h3>CREDIT</h3><p><strong>Class Design, Writing and Development </strong>Dr. Razno</p><p><strong>Layout </strong>by Ophan, based on the official Fabula Ultima layout by Emanuele Galletto</p>",

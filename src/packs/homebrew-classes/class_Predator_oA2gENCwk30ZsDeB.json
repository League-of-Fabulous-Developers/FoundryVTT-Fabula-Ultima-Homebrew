Others have just learned to profit from human suffering. In a world where everything has a soul, even the most mundane sort of predation can twist a person’s nature until they are barely recognizable.</p><p>But not all are Predators by choice. Some fight to change, whether by lifting a curse, learning better, or just finding worthy targets. In the meantime, they try to bend their cruel powers to the benefit of allies and former victims.</p><hr><h5><strong>PREDATOR FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum Hit Points by 5.</li></ul><h2><strong>PREDATOR SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.ggXXiDX5jxP77Nm4]{Blood is Life} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>When an ally casts a spell that includes you among the targets, they may choose to spend <strong>【SL】 </strong>Hit Points to allow you to regain <strong>【SL × 3】</strong>Hit Points (in addition to any the spell may give you.)</p><p>When an enemy casts a spell that includes you among the targets, you may spend <strong>【SL】 </strong>Hit Points to deal <strong>【SL × 3】 </strong>dark damage to them.</p><hr><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.5BBwd1SlBOz3cpWN]{Children of the Night}</p><p>You can communicate with creatures of the <strong>beast</strong>, <strong>undead</strong>, and <strong>demon</strong> Species.

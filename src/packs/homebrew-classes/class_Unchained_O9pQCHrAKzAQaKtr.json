Describe an NPC who should still be indebted to you for this.</p><p>The GM then chooses and expresses one additional difficulty that exists because of this: an influential local person has declared that they will take revenge on you, local people don't want to be seen or associated with you, your head is being actively searched for with a bounty at stake, one of your former contacts has been captured and may divulge things about you, and so on.</p><hr /><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.iOhl9vl5nZcGuMc7]{Sabotage Champion} (SL3)</strong></h4><p>You get a <strong>【SL】 </strong>bonus to your Study or Hinder rolls and to any rolls made to sabotage machines, open locks, arm or disarm traps, or to search for loopholes in any security system.</p></div><hr /><div class=\"stackedit__html\"><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.ahb9YXvPFxbSxiZL]{Guerilla} (SL5)</strong></h4><p>After successfully using Study on them, you inflict <strong>【SL × 2】</strong> additional damage and ignore resistances on enemies you attack if they represent or follow an authority figure.</p></div><hr /><div class=\"stackedit__html\"><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.7UyJmOdJ7kOIUP1F]{Observer} (SL3)</strong></h4></div><p>As a action, you can analyze an NPC's behavior and spend up to <strong>【SL × 10】 </strong>MP to ask the GM one question for every 10 MP spent, among :</p><ul><li><p>What are they paying attention to at the moment?</p></li><li><p>What is their current state of mind?</p></li><li><p>What would it take to attract or divert their attention?</p></li><li><p>What is odd about their immediate behavior?</p></li><li><p>What would it take to get in this person's good graces in this situation?</p></li></ul><hr /><div class=\"stackedit__html\"><h4><strong>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.5TvwkeevywBR9GZB]{Reputation Among Rebels} (SL2)</strong></h4><p>When you request a place to sleep or transportation from a rebel group, you reduce the price of this service by <strong>【SL × 10】</strong>z per night of rest or day of travel for each person in your group.

    "description": "<h5><strong>ALSO: Stalker, Tracker, Trapper</strong></h5><p><strong>Hunters</strong> are masters of the wild — expert trackers, survivalists, and trappers who possess a deep understanding, respect, and connection to nature or the environment in which they specialize in hunting. They revere the cycle of life and often form a symbiotic bond with the creatures they hunt, utilizing the abilities and instincts of their quarry to enhance their own. While some Hunters prefer a nomadic life, others take root and become one with their habitat, whether natural, urban or rural. Therefore,the Hunter's prowess extends beyond the natural world and can be adapted to any terrain, from populous cities to desolate landscapes.</p><hr><h5><strong>HUNTER FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><ul><li>Permanently increase your maximum IP by 2.</li><li>Gain the ability to equip <strong>martial ranged weapons</strong> and <strong>martial melee weapons</strong>.</li></ul><h2><strong>HUNTER SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.G3PsZ2JOeBn3tQlL]{Lock-on}</p><p>You may use an action and spend 10 Mind Points to lock onto a target.

They might even be right. However, there cannot be emancipation without violence.</p><hr><h5>MALEFACTOR<strong> FREE BENEFITS</strong></h5><p>❖ Permanently increase your maximum Mind Points by 5.<br>❖ You may perform Rituals whose effects fall within the <strong>Ritualism</strong> discipline.</p><h2>MALEFACTOR<strong> SKILLS</strong></h2><p>@UUID[Compendium.fabula-ultima-homebrew.homebrew-skills.Item.zeGS65Cq8PTfpw6c]{Exploit} <strong>(SL5)</strong></p><p>As an Action during a <strong>Conflict</strong>, you can spend 10 Mind Points to begin exploiting the afflictions of your enemies.

Prepare the terrain as best as you can!</p></li><li><p>Upon touching the trap, a creature rolls an Opposed <strong>【DEX + INS】</strong> Check against you. You gain a bonus equal to <strong>【SL】 </strong>on this check. If your trap has the multi property, only one check is required. You or the Game Master decide which additional creatures are affected.</p></li><li><p>If the creature that touched the trap passes the opposed check, <strong>the trap fails,</strong> and <strong>you lose the IP</strong> spent. The enemy might be now aware of your presence.</p></li><li><p>At any point during the scene, if the trap remains untouched and there are no foes observing you, you may <strong>safely disable it</strong> and recover your <strong>IP</strong>.</p></li><li><p>If, for any reason, you leave the scene before retrieving an untouched trap, the Game Master may decide, depending on the circumstances of your departure, whether you have retrieved the trap.</p></li></ul><p></p>"

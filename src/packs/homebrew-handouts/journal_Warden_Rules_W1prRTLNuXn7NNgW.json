Usually, they take up a small area - a building, hill, grove, or small community - but larger Sanctuaries aren’t any more powerful or important. A Warden will need to understand the story and nature of a place in order to <strong>bind</strong> it, which can be a different trial for each one.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Even when you are far away, the spirits of your Sanctuaries are always close at hand. On your turn in a conflict scene, you may spend an Action to Haunt other creatures that you have a Bond with in the scene, paying 5 Mind Points for the first Haunting, 10 for the second on the same turn, and 15 for each beyond that.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You can banish any number of Hauntings on your turn, either before or after your action, which removes their benefit or drawback from the creatures and frees them to Haunt another creature.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">You cannot Haunt yourself, and each Sanctuary can only Haunt one creature at a time. Each Sanctuary has two mechanical effects. A Haunt is the benefit (or drawback) that a creature gets when you use Bind and Haunt to grant them its spirit. Ritual is a broad description of the types of Rituals that become easier when carried out at that site. The GM might allow a Mind Point discount, a stronger effect, or a cushion for failure to such Rituals there.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Unless otherwise noted, each creature can only be Haunted by the spirit of one Sanctuary, and you can only Haunt one creature with the spirit of a given Sanctuary at a time.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Here are some example Sanctuaries</span></p>"

Like the Arcanist, you will need to be careful to keep that character from dominating.</p></li><li><p>Alternatively, you could use the Sanctuaries as a way to convey that the history of the world is much greater and more varied than the current Villain and their schemes.</p></li><li><p>Consider changing the Rituals that particular Sanctuaries encourage in response to the campaign’s events. Look at the Astral Palace, above. What if Epiala’s culture starts to change as a result of the heroes’ work?</p></li><li><p>This class demands attention to the Bonds within the party and their allies, but the goal is not to incentivize maximizing any one type of relationship. If your table enjoys fitting character interactions into conflict scenes, Haunts like the Wrathful Majin above, which round-by-round consumes the Hauntee with hatred and rage, can be especially fun. The effects of some Haunts are complex, but that complexity can be spread out over a campaign. For Haunts that vary, players can focus on their specific relationship with the Warden and the effect it has, noting when it changes.</p></li></ul><h4><strong>@ICON[header]</strong> ADAPTATION</h4><ul><li><p>The sites don’t have to be literal, physical locations in the world. If you want to go hard into the Bond aspect of this class and take some inspiration from Persona or Disgaea, you could even have the Sanctuaries be within characters! This would require some tweaks to Ritual rules and Soul Offering, of course.</p></li><li><p>(How would you play it if they were within party members? Having the “host” player take over GM duties for that session? I’m thinking about this too much already.)</p></li><li><p>The Alpha Beast was included with the example heroes as an out-there implementation of the class - a Godzilla-like territorial antihero who will protect his Sanctuaries from all comers and regards the party as his “pack.” The character’s ego might need to be cut down to size, but their player will cooperate in making that happen.</p></li></ul>"

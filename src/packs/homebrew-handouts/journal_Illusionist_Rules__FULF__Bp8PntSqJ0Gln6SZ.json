They <strong>aren't</strong> capable of reason or logic.</p></li><li><p>They only follow <strong>simple one-clause</strong> commands and cannot abstract meaning or extrapolate from them. For example, if you ask a Phantasm to grab some milk, it knows where the milk is because you do. It also knows that you are feeling thirsty — because you know it too. However, it won't understand that milk can quench thirst, nor will it know to pour the milk into a glass; these thought processes are too complex for Phantasms. So, it would just bring you the whole bottle of milk, with a deadpan look.</p></li><li><p>Phantasms <strong>share</strong> your <strong>base Attributes</strong> and <strong>defenses</strong>, have <strong>no MP,</strong> and their <strong>Phantasmal Vitality</strong> (<strong>PV</strong>) is equal to your base <strong>INS die size plus your level.</strong> They are <strong>immune</strong> to all status effects.</p></li><li><p>They have <strong>no Initiative score</strong>. Phantasms do not get a turn during conflicts, but on your turn, you can use <strong>an action</strong> to command one or more Phantasms, depending on the spell being used.</p></li><li><p>Phantasms always target <strong>Magical Defense</strong>.</p></li><li><p>If your Phantasms fall to <strong>0 PV</strong>, they <strong>shatter</strong>. You can also shatter them through skills, spells, or at will. If you fall to <strong>0 HP</strong> or leave a scene, your Phantasms <strong>shatter</strong>.</p></li><li><p>You may create a Phantasm and command it in the <strong>same action</strong>. After this first command—which directly follows its creation—on your next turn, it requires a whole action to be commanded again. Therefore, you <strong>cannot</strong> command Phantasm 1 and then proceed to create Phantasm 2 in the same action.</p></li><li><p>Unless stated otherwise, you can have up to <strong>3 Phantasms active</strong> at the same time. Attempts to cast more Phantasms beyond 3 will fail. </p></li></ul><p></p>"

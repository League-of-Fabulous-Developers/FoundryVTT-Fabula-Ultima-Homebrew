This should be the subject of a Clock of at least 6 sections (and more likely 10 or 12 for traits that strongly define an NPC). When a Clock seeking to push an antagonist to question themself is filled, you should replace at least one of their dark traits with a temporary trait that represents the antagonist's doubt or questioning: confused, unsure, troubled, etc. However, the next time the antagonist meets the group, this trait should have evolved into a new one, which may or may not be a new dark trait.</p><p>During a conflict, if an enemy no longer possesses any dark trait, it should be fairly simple to convince them to stop fighting: via a Clock of 4 to 6 sections maximum. The GM chooses how the enemy abandons the conflict: Do they let the PCs go? Do they lay down their weapons? Do they flee? etc.</p>"
